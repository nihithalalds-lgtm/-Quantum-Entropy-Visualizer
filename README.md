# Quantum Entropy Visualizer — Incident Response Simulator

This project simulates quantum entropy variations over time to visualize quantum incidents and responses.
It’s built with Streamlit and can export results to Word reports.

## Features
- Interactive Streamlit GUI
- Quantum entropy computation (Von Neumann)
- Entropy vs time graph
- Word report generator
- Incident response simulation notes

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the app
```bash
streamlit run quantum_entropy_visualizer.py
```
